Use this moment of stillness to form your plan of attack so you're sure about how to proceed.\",\n",

Petty jealousy and gossip about other people's lives are especially irrelevant in your world.\",\n",

Be careful of spending all your resources on pleasure without setting something aside for leaner times. The company you keep could encourage your self-destructive behaviors.

Make good use of this fantastic boost of energy by conquering your own goals and demons instead of using it to wage war on anyone else. Other people should know to get out of your way when you have your mind set on doing something. If they don't, politely ask them to move instead of steamrolling over them.\",\n",

You may not be able to control the hand you're dealt, but you can certainly control how you play it.\",\n",

Perhaps you exchange ideas about UFOs and life on other planets. Suddenly you're looking at your life as if you were a character in a science-fiction novel.

Motivated by a desire to give dinner parties and invite family members who live far away to come for a visit, you get to work repainting, wallpapering, and maybe even sending that sofa out to be reupholstered. The final result will be fantastic, Pisces. You’ll be proud.',\n",

This could be a frustrating day. Keep yourself busy at home.',\n",

By tomorrow you'll probably have made peace with yourself, and should have done some growing up in the meantime. Hang in there!\",\n",

You might be tempted to jump to the erroneous conclusion that your beloved no longer cares about you and that's why your phone isn't ringing. Don't fall into this trap. If you try to be objective, you'll realize that this isn't true. Chances are that your friend was held up in some way and will call as soon as there's an opportunity.\",\n",

You can't sense what others are feeling, and oracles like the I Ching just don't make sense any more. You may try to fall back on logic, but that doesn't work today either. Don't think this is a permanent situation, however. Your mental biorhythms are low. You should be back to normal in a few days.\",\n",

Today, however, you're going through a fit of laziness. Chances are you don't want to do a thing except lie around and read or watch TV. It's OK. We all need time to let our hair down and relax. Don't suffer undue guilt because you don't feel like working.\",\n",

You've been working hard and are stressed out, so you probably look tired. You're apt to blow it all out of proportion, however, and think you look a lot worse than you actually do.

Today you could stop at the travel agent’s office, the one you've walked by countless times, and stare at the pictures. Thailand, Hong Kong, and New Zealand are just a few of the places you'd like to see. The pictures look so enticing. Go ahead. Plan such a trip, although it’s likely to be only a temporary diversion. Your wanderlust indicates a fundamental restlessness that must be resolved.\",\n",

Travel is definitely in the picture, as is continuing your education in some way. It could be something simple, such as enrolling in a cooking class at an adult education center. Or perhaps you're going to fulfill a lifelong ambition and apply to business school. Good for you!\",\n",

Who can blame your guests for wanting to stay?',\n",

In the meantime, Leo, take care of your physical needs. If your body craves exercise, why not increase your jogging miles or add extra time to your gym workout? Absence does make the heart grow fonder, after all.',\n",

Be sure to have a nutritious breakfast and lunch today, because you’re likely to work right through dinner.\",\n",

For example, you could take in a matinee of the scariest movie in town or finally try out that Ethiopian restaurant you've been hearing so much about. Today brings a perfect opportunity to make lemonade out of lemons.\",\n",

One way to distract the family is to get them to clean up the house in anticipation of a warm welcome!\",\n",

All you need to do is use it. If your thoughts aren't clear, sit down and write your ideas out. Note the steps you need to take in order to get things rolling and then make your move. Don't let fear or insecurity hold you back!\",\n",

Connecting with this can be extremely uplifting, as it can put everything into perspective for you. With your hardworking tendencies, it can be easy to drift from the things that are most important to you as a person. Make the most of this day by getting in touch with yourself. If you keep a journal, explore your mood on paper.',\n",

If this happens, the wisest thing might be to pull out. When you're in this position (especially with two people you care about), the outcome winds up hurting someone, and it may just be you. If you tell them you care about them both too much to get involved, chances are you'll be far better off.\",\n",

Why not tackle those closets, attic, and storerooms? If you have to work, your desk, workspace, and filing cabinets could use a little attention. Just think how great it will feel when everything is in order! Make the most of your energy by accomplishing as much as you can.\",\n",

Try something fun like engaging in sports or taking a pooch for a walk. Gardening and cutting the lawn are other activities that are better for you than sitting all day. The physical movement can reduce stress and give you a sense of accomplishment. Every part of you benefits from being active. Check it out.\",\n",

It’s essential for feeling you have control over your life. It can be almost impossible to reach your goals without a concrete plan. Just as you wouldn't build a house without a plan, it isn't wise to build a life without one either.\",\n",
       " \"Taurus for 2020-02-08 00:00:00: Today is a good day to think about your ambitions, Taurus. Considering what you really want out of life can be instrumental in setting goals and making dreams come true. Reaching them can often be as simple as making a decision and taking that first step. For example, if your dream is to have your ideal partner, and you're with someone who isn't, the practical choice is to end the current relationship. Fear, worry, and lack of confidence are the things that can keep you from moving.\",\n",
       " \"Gemini for 2020-02-08 00:00:00: You might be feeling a bit more hesitant than usual when it comes to making decisions, Gemini. Even if someone accuses you of being distrustful, it's your sense of caution that saves you a lot of grief. If a person or situation has you feeling skeptical, there is probably a good reason for it. Examine what you need in order to feel comfortable, but not to the extreme that you deny yourself opportunity.\",\n",

Try not to take it personally. Just because you know where you're coming from doesn't mean the other person does. It may simply be a communication problem. Make the effort to clarify your position. If this doesn't suffice, it isn’t your problem any more. The other person will have to look at his or her trust issues.\",\n",

Whether there's something that needs to be worked out or you simply miss him or her, take the steps needed to connect, even if it takes email, letters, or a phone call to get in touch. Rather than having them pop into your head continuously, reach out and make contact.\",\n",
       " \"Virgo for 2020-02-08 00:00:00: Your usual outgoing and often radical nature may be far more conservative today, Virgo. This can be a result of the day's planetary influences, and if used well, this mood can prove most beneficial. It can add seriousness to your day that suits such activities as goal setting, budget planning, or recovery. Make the most of this energy by digging into the areas of your life that could use some rethinking.\",\n",

You can be compassionate to a fault, in that too much of your energy goes to helping solve others’ problems. Then you're left without enough focus for yourself and the things that are troubling you. See about spending some time alone to concentrate on any issues you have. Reach out to a trusted friend for guidance and support. Allow someone to nurture you for a change.\",\n",

Many think that New Year's Day and birthdays are prime times to make resolutions or set goals, yet this is something that can be done any time. In fact, it's advisable to renew, rename, and revamp ambitions on a regular basis, since life brings constant change to circumstances. Pull out some paper and jot your ideas down.\",\n",

It could be someone you know well, but chances are it will be someone you’d least expect to be there for you. With your tendency to keep to yourself and be on the quiet side, you may not always notice those around you. Yet this doesn't mean that they don't notice you. Embrace a new friend and the support offered when the opportunity arises.\",\n",

This can serve you well when it comes to getting what you want, provided no one suffers in the process. It isn’t generally in your nature to step on anyone on the way up the ladder, and you aren’t likely to feel good if this occurs. Look at all possible ways to attain your goals. You're sure to find something that suits you that isn’t harmful to others.\",\n",

Do you have a realistic budget, or does yours exclude such things as entertainment, gifts, and occasional splurges? Such a budget won't suffice, because these are expenses that everyone has. Take a good look at your spending habits and see where you could cut back without too much pain.\",\n",
       " 'Pisces for 2020-02-08 00:00:00: Take the time to consider your physical and mental health today, Pisces. Given your hard-driving nature, these are areas that may be neglected. One really affects the other. If you overwork your brain or put off dealing with problems, your physical health will suffer. Things like excess weight, addiction, and bouts of depression are all indicators that there is an imbalance in your life. See about getting things more in sync.',\n",
       " 'Aries for 2020-02-07 00:00:00: If something is bothering you today, Aries, consider talking with your mother or an older person you feel comfortable with.

Remember to express your gratitude for this supportive relationship.',\n",

Yet while we can’t always control what happens around and to us, we always have the choice as to how we\\'re going to handle it. Grieving can be a critical element to healing, but there\\'s a fine line. Choose to keep going and insist on being better to yourself.',\n",

Your nature is one that thrives on intense thought, creativity, sexuality, and emotion. Without adequate time alone in a space that’s comfortable for you, you may begin to feel worn out. Such things as irritability or withdrawal can be strong indicators that it's high time you were alone with yourself. Make some plans for this today.\",\n",

The joy of creating something is immeasurable, and the process of producing a finished product can be very enjoyable and therapeutic. Crafts, baking, building, and gardening are all activities conducive to this. Take time to express yourself through your favorite hobbies today.',\n",

This can be a lot of fun to do, especially if the person on the receiving end isn't expecting anything from you. Pictures, crafts, cookies, candies, or books can make a wonderful package to send to someone special. Even a simple greeting card can really brighten someone's day. Have some fun.\",\n",

Pull out your favorite craft supplies and have some fun exploring color and design. If you have children, consider including them in the activities. It may amaze you to listen to the incredible ideas and innovative thoughts your own kids have that you’ve never thought of. If you don\\'t have an \"idea box\" where old bottles, nuts and bolts, odd buttons, ribbons, and scraps of material can collect for times like this, start one today!',\n",

This is because it provides an avenue for you to communicate with a deeper part of yourself. Your sensitive nature can find comfort and hope through harmonies and rhythms like nothing else. Pull out your favorites and listen, sing along, or even dance. Enjoy your day to the fullest!',\n",

Your ability to be thrifty and efficient will be strengthened at this time, so why not take advantage of it? Take a few minutes to look through recent flyers or gather coupons before heading out. And if you find yourself feeling tempted to spend your savings on something lavish, get back to your list! Keep your budget in the forefront of your mind and head straight to the checkout when you're done.\",\n",

The energetic aspects that are occurring can really have you raring to take on chores that need to be done. Can you think of anything you'd rather do? Well, OK, but once you've finished these things, there should be plenty of time to do something recreational, too. Make the most of this great day to get into both work and play.\",\n",

If there are some things you really need to care of, you can still make plans for leisure or recreation afterward. Spoil yourself with an afternoon nap or ordering out for dinner. Take a leisurely walk or a long bath. Take care of yourself by resting as well as accomplishing.',\n",

Whether you have a huge list of things you want to get done or you were planning on just taking it easy, don't turn your friend away. Chores and hobbies will wait patiently for you, but lending care and support to someone in need often won't. Open your door and your heart if the situation arises.\",\n",

If you live alone, there isn't much chance that your plans will affect anyone, but for those of you cohabiting with others, take time to extend this courtesy. It might be that someone else in the house had some intentions that you weren't aware of, or there may be someone in need of something from you. Talk things over and everything will work out just fine.\",\n",
       " \"Aries for 2020-02-06 00:00:00: When was the last time you used a pen and paper, Aries? In this age of computers, the keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides much more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of the rhythmic motion of writing with a pen is far more soothing and even healing than most realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good and unlock places within you that aren't accessed by typing. Try it today.\",\n",
       " \"Taurus for 2020-02-06 00:00:00: Today may bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Taurus. With this, verbal communication is also more likely to be effective. Consider seizing this energy by making a point of talking through any problems or issues you have with those in your life. If they don't live with you, see about driving over to visit them or calling them up to work things out. If there isn't anything pressing, see about expressing your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.\",\n",

Slowing down will likely elude you and you’ll have to find one means or another to express what's racing around in your head. The aspects today lend much to communication. Perhaps talking over your writing or ideas with someone whose insight you value will do the trick. Even doodling can give you a place to put your thoughts. Explore these activities today.\",\n",

Or perhaps you can look in the events page in your local newspaper and see whether a meeting or lecture is taking place that you'd like to attend.

Chances are you’re surrounded by others most of the time, and when you don't take time to be alone with your thoughts and feelings, it can prove unhealthy for you. Taking care of your emotional well-being is critical, as you have a deeply sensitive nature. With continuous activity around you, there's no time to connect with this part of you. Make time today.\",\n",

Either way, if you're uncomfortable following through, communicate that to this person. Your ability to express yourself and be understood is enhanced with this day's energy.

Make sure you show your support to people in all situations. Don't be just a fair-weather friend. Your loyalty to others may be tested today when conflict arises and tempers get high.\",\n",
       " \"Gemini for 2020-01-24 00:00:00: Realize that your inner state of mind is quite apparent to people just by the look on your face, Gemini.

Your emotional state should be strong, so use this to your advantage.\",\n",

This is one of those days in which emotional outbursts could explode in your face as a result of other people's reactions to your pressure. Don't feel like you need to take on the responsibility of everyone else's actions. You may be having a hard enough time dealing with your own personal issues.\",\n",

You have a greater amount of emotional strength than usual, and you'll find that it's important that you hold on to this feeling against all odds.

People may be a bit stingy with everything from money to emotions to time spent with loved ones. The more you tell someone else that they're wrong, the more that person is going to reject your advice. In general, this is a good time to simply stay out of other people's way.\",\n",

It could be extremely tempting to roll with the crowd and participate in all the fun. You don't want to miss out on a single thing going on around you. Resist the temptation to disregard the important messages that are coming from your body. Slow down.\",\n",

This is one of those days in which you may end up wasting your time and everyone else's by continuing to insist that things be done a certain way. If you want to do something your way, then do it. If someone else wants to do something his or her way, then let that person do it.\",\n",

This not only increases your career standing, it can help you in the love department. Enjoy your day!\",\n",

Don't limit yourself!\",\n",

Books and articles about people who have had similar experiences could increase your understanding of them. Don't fight it! Go with the flow.\",\n",

It will also help to attend classes or workshops or simply to discuss the subject with a friend. Knowledge is essential.',\n",

The drive to exercise, particularly if you do it alone and outdoors, is likely to get the endorphins going and thus give you a natural high, which could lead to an increased level of inspiration and intuition. After you finish, it might be a good idea to sit in a park, preferably near water, to allow yourself to come down. Meditate and take a close look at your inner state.',\n",

Your level of intuition is very high, so be prepared for some unusually strong psychic messages.\",\n",

This might represent the attainment of a long-term goal you've been striving to reach, and therefore you're apt to be rather excited about it. Tonight, go out and celebrate your success with your friends.\",\n",
